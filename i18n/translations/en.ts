    // --- FAQs ---
    'faq_q1_q': 'What is Burmese Amber (Burmite)?',
    'faq_q1_a': 'Burmese Amber, or Burmite, is a rare fossilized tree resin from the Hukawng Valley in Myanmar, dating back nearly 100 million years to the Cretaceous period. It is famous for its hardness and the incredible diversity of prehistoric inclusions (like insects and plants) found within it.',
    'faq_q2_q': 'Is your amber authentic?',
    'faq_q2_a': 'Absolutely. We guarantee that every piece of amber we sell is 100% authentic, natural Burmese Amber. Every piece is verified by our expert gemologists. You can learn more about our commitment on the <a href="/#/our-guarantee" class="text-[var(--c-accent-primary)] hover:underline">Our Guarantee</a> page.',
    'faq_q3_q': 'How do I care for my amber jewelry?',
    'faq_q3_a': 'Amber is an organic gem and requires gentle care. Clean it with a soft cloth and lukewarm water. Avoid harsh chemicals, perfumes, extreme heat, and storing it with harder jewelry that could scratch it. For detailed instructions, please visit our <a href="/#/policies/care-guide" class="text-[var(--c-accent-primary)] hover:underline">Care Guide</a>.',
    'faq_q4_q': 'Do you ship internationally?',
    'faq_q4_a': 'Yes, we ship worldwide. All shipments are fully insured for your peace of mind. For more details on shipping times and costs, please see our <a href="/#/policies/shipping" class="text-[var(--c-accent-primary)] hover:underline">Shipping Policy</a>.',
    'faq_q5_q': 'Can I create a custom piece?',
    'faq_q5_a': 'Yes! We specialize in custom pre-orders. You can use our <a href="/#/build-your-set" class="text-[var(--c-accent-primary)] hover:underline">Build Your Pre-Order</a> tool to design your own mala or bracelet. For more complex designs, please contact us directly.',
    'faq_q6_q': 'What makes Burmite different from Baltic amber?',
    'faq_q6_a': 'The main differences are age and hardness. Burmite is over twice as old as Baltic amber (~99 million years vs. ~44 million years) and is significantly harder. This allows for more intricate carving and makes it more durable.',
    'faq_q7_q': 'What does the "Grade" (Standard, Silver, High) mean?',
    'faq_q7_a': 'The grade refers to the quality of the amber. For most colors, it relates to clarity (fewer inclusions). However, for special types like Mila Amber, it refers to the richness of its internal texture, and for Black Amber, it refers to the purity of the black color. You can read more in our <a href="/#/pricing-guide" class="text-[var(--c-accent-primary)] hover:underline">Pricing Guide</a>.',
    'faq_q8_q': 'Why do larger beads cost so much more?',
    'faq_q8_a': 'The price increases exponentially with size. This is because it is much rarer to find large, flawless pieces of raw amber to carve big beads from, and the crafting process carries a higher risk. A single large bead might require raw material that could have made dozens of smaller beads.',
    'faq_q9_q': 'What is your return policy?',
    'faq_q9_a': 'Due to the personal nature of amber, we generally do not accept returns for changes of mind. Returns are accepted if you receive an incorrect item or if an item is proven to be not authentic by a certified lab. Please read our full <a href="/#/policies/returns" class="text-[var(--c-accent-primary)] hover:underline">Return Policy</a>.',
    'faq_q10_q': 'Is your sourcing ethical?',
    'faq_q10_a': 'We are deeply committed to ethical sourcing. We work directly with small-scale, trusted miners and artisans in Myanmar to ensure fair compensation and respect for the local communities and environment.',
    'faq_q11_q': 'What is GIT certification?',
    'faq_q11_a': 'GIT stands for The Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand. It is a reputable national institute that provides quality testing and certification for gemstones, ensuring they meet high standards of authenticity and quality.',
    'faq_q12_q': 'Can I visit your showroom?',
    'faq_q12_a': 'Yes, we welcome visitors to our showroom in the Jewelry Trade Center in Bangkok, Thailand. Please <a href="/#/contact" class="text-[var(--c-accent-primary)] hover:underline">contact us</a> to schedule an appointment.',
